  <p>Over the past few years, I have enjoyed working through the problems of the
<a href="https://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> series as learning exercises. I have
used them to dip my toe into new languages, but I have generally done them
ad-hoc without a lot of discussion or analysis. I&rsquo;ll be starting a series on
this blog discussing the Advent of Code problems in the context of similar
problems in computer science, analyzing the complexity of the problem and
possible solutions, and discussing implementation details. I hope you find these
posts enlightening.</p>

<p>I will update this post with links to new posts in this series as I make them,
so feel free to bookmark this post as a shortcut.</p>

  <p>I just wanted to share this note from <a href="https://reddit.com/u/hamsterdave">hamsterdave</a> on <a href="https://reddit.com">reddit</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&rdquo;&hellip; I&rsquo;m a storm chaser with a fair amount of experience with hurricanes, including both of the 2 most recent Carolina landfalls, Arthur and Matthew. This storm will not be like either of those, or like anything the US mainland has seen in a long time. It isn&rsquo;t going to just be a storm surge disaster like Katrina, or a rainer like Harvey, or catastrophic wind damage like Andrew. It has the potential to be all three, and could very well (if it doesn&rsquo;t slow down too much before land fall) be the most powerful hurricane to make landfall on the US mainland since Andrew in 1992. The Carolina coast has had a prolonged quiet period with only a few relatively minor hurricane strikes in the last 20 years. It is imperative that people do not fall victim to complacency with this storm. &hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <span class="post-date">Sun, Jul 15, 2018</span>
  <p>I found a new project earlier this summer.</p>

<p>I had lost my old barbecue thermometer in our move last year. My mother- and father-in-law bought me a new Bluetooth one for my birthday this year. Unfortunately, it had two big drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>It could only handle two probe jacks.</li>
<li>Bluetooth range, while nominally 100 meters, depends on the transmit power and it was clearly obvious that in order to save power that transmit power had been reduced on this device; it would not cover the house.</li>
</ul>

<p>After considering the problem, I decided that WiFi would be a better connection mechanism to use, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>My primary router has line-of-sight to the grill</li>
<li>it would afford me the ability to run an errand while still being able to monitor the status of my cook (with somebody at home keeping an eye on things&hellip; come on!).</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I started looking around, and found out that there wasn&rsquo;t really much on the market that had 4 probes AND WiFi, and what there was, was quite extensive.</p>

<p>Also in my searching, I found <a href="https://store.heatermeter.com">HeaterMeter</a>, and became intrigued. The price was still a bit high, and it included capabilities that I just didn&rsquo;t need (like a fan controller, for example). However, I thought &ndash; what&rsquo;s keeping me from building my own similar device? This way, I could build it exactly how I wanted, and have complete control over everything. In particular, I could make sure I was using high-quality probes, like <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Handheld-Probes/Probes/Pro-Series">these high-quality probes from ThermoWorks, the same guys that make the ThermaPen</a>.</p>

<p>So I started thinking, and planning, and prototyping. This weekend, I hit two big milestones: I finished the code for everything local to the device (buttons, alarm, display), and I had a successful test of my calibration, with the thermometer reading within 1°F compared to a reference at multiple temperatures.</p>

<p><img src="/posts/bbiq/bbiq_proto.png" alt="BBiQ proto-prototype" /></p>

<p>For this proto-prototype, I&rsquo;m building with an old <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3">Arduino Uno</a> that I&rsquo;ve had for awhile, then connecting it to a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-b-plus/">Raspberry Pi B+</a> with an <a href="https://www.edimax.com/edimax/merchandise/merchandise_detail/data/edimax/in/wireless_adapters_n150/ew-7811un/">Edimax N150</a> mini WiFi adapter. I plan to use the <a href="https://blynk.cc">Blynk</a> service for the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; functionality, including notifications and history graphs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this means the prototype will be huge and power-hungry, not ideal traits. While I had originally planned on using a Raspberry Pi Zero W in the &ldquo;final&rdquo; version, after doing more research I discovered the <a href="https://www.esp8266.com">ESP8266</a> WiFi microcontroller, and began to hatch a plan.</p>

<p>Once I&rsquo;m satisfied with the functionality of this initial prototype, I&rsquo;m going to build a &ldquo;final&rdquo; prototype:</p>

<ul>
<li>Based on a <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyLC.html">Teensy LC</a> dev board (itself based on an ARM Cortex M0+ microcontroller)</li>
<li>WiFi provided by an ESP8266 &ldquo;backpack&rdquo;</li>
<li>128x32 monochrome OLED display replacing the large backlight character LCD</li>
<li>Powered by 2xAA batteries</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m confident that by carefully managing the power states on both the Teensy and the ESP8266 that I can keep the average power draw under 100mA, which would give 20+ hours of battery life on one pair of rechargeable AAs. In addition, this version should end up being about the size of an original iPod, if not smaller (really, the batteries are going to dominate the size at that point).</p>

<p>Assuming everything goes well and I feel the urge, I could build my own board based on the Freescale microcontroller that Teensy LC uses&hellip; but if I can already get the battery life I&rsquo;m looking for, what&rsquo;s the point? :)</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/e3b0c442/BBiQ">Source and schematics</a>, if you want to follow my progress. Check the prototype branch if there&rsquo;s nothing on master.</p>

  <p>The better question is&hellip; why not?</p>

<p>Not satisfied? Fine. I have an interest in cryptography, and e3b0c442 represents the first 16 bytes of an SHA256 hash on an empty input:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ echo '' | shasum -a 256 -0
