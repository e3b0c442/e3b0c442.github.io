  </h1>
  <span class="post-date">Sat, Dec 22, 2018</span>
  <p>Santa spent so much time working on his efficiency, he&rsquo;s run out of time for
stocking-stuffers and has decided to start an initial coin offering instead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Santa needs help mining some AdventCoins (very similar to bitcoins) to use as gifts for all the economically forward-thinking little girls and boys.</p>

<p>To do this, he needs to find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5</a> hashes which, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a>, start with at least <strong>five zeroes</strong>. The input to the MD5 hash is some secret key (your puzzle input, given below) followed by a number in decimal. To mine AdventCoins, you must find Santa the lowest positive number (no leading zeroes: <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, &hellip;) that produces such a hash.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>If your secret key is <code>abcdef</code>, the answer is <code>609043</code>, because the MD5 hash of <code>abcdef609043</code> starts with five zeroes (<code>000001dbbfa...</code>), and it is the lowest such number to do so.</li>
<li>If your secret key is <code>pqrstuv</code>, the lowest number it combines with to make an MD5 hash starting with five zeroes is <code>1048970</code>; that is, the MD5 hash of <code>pqrstuv1048970</code> looks like <code>000006136ef...</code>.</li>
</ul>

  </h1>
  <span class="post-date">Fri, Dec 21, 2018</span>
  <p>The elves have everything wrapped up, and it&rsquo;s time for Santa to do some more deliveries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Santa is delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses.</p>

<p>He begins by delivering a present to the house at his starting location, and then an elf at the North Pole calls him via radio and tells him where to move next. Moves are always exactly one house to the north (<code>^</code>), south (<code>v</code>), east (<code>&gt;</code>), or west (<code>&lt;</code>). After each move, he delivers another present to the house at his new location.</p>

<p>However, the elf back at the north pole has had a little too much eggnog, and so his directions are a little off, and Santa ends up visiting some houses more than once. How many houses receive <strong>at least one present</strong>?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>&gt;</code> delivers presents to <code>2</code> houses: one at the starting location, and one to the east.</li>
<li><code>^&gt;v&lt;</code> delivers presents to <code>4</code> houses in a square, including twice to the house at his starting/ending location.</li>
<li><code>^v^v^v^v^v</code> delivers a bunch of presents to some very lucky children at only <code>2</code> houses.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Santa was able to deliver his presents to the large apartment building. Now, his
elves need wrapping paper and ribbon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. They have a list of the dimensions (length <code>l</code>, width <code>w</code>, and height <code>h</code>) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.</p>

<p>Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect right rectangular prism), which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box, which is <code>2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l</code>. The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>A present with dimensions <code>2x3x4</code> requires <code>2*6 + 2*12 + 2*8 = 52</code> square feet of wrapping paper plus <code>6</code> square feet of slack, for a total of <code>58</code> square feet.</li>
<li>A present with dimensions <code>1x1x10</code> requires <code>2*1 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 42</code> square feet of wrapping paper plus <code>1</code> square foot of slack, for a total of <code>43</code> square feet.</li>
</ul>

<p>All numbers in the elves&rsquo; list are in feet. How many total <strong>square feet of wrapping paper</strong> should they order?</p>

  </h1>
  <span class="post-date">Fri, Dec 21, 2018</span>
  <p>Advent of Code debuted on December 1, 2015, with this puzzle:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can&rsquo;t find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor <code>0</code>) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.</p>

<p>An opening parenthesis, <code>(</code>, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, <code>)</code>, means he should go down one floor.</p>

<p>The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>(())</code> and <code>()()</code> both result in floor <code>0</code>.</li>
<li><code>(((</code> and <code>(()(()(</code> both result in floor <code>3</code>.</li>
<li><code>))(((((</code> also results in floor <code>3</code>.</li>
<li><code>())</code> and <code>))(</code> both result in floor <code>-1</code> (the first basement level).</li>
<li><code>)))</code> and <code>)())())</code> both result in floor <code>-3</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To <strong>what floor</strong> do the instructions take Santa?</p>

  <p>Over the past few years, I have enjoyed working through the problems of the
<a href="https://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> series as learning exercises. I have
used them to dip my toe into new languages, but I have generally done them
ad-hoc without a lot of discussion or analysis. I&rsquo;ll be starting a series on
this blog discussing the Advent of Code problems in the context of similar
problems in computer science, analyzing the complexity of the problem and
possible solutions, and discussing implementation details. In each post, I will
cover both of the days problems as seperate, even though in many cases
they are similar.

  <p>I just wanted to share this note from <a href="https://reddit.com/u/hamsterdave">hamsterdave</a> on <a href="https://reddit.com">reddit</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&rdquo;&hellip; I&rsquo;m a storm chaser with a fair amount of experience with hurricanes, including both of the 2 most recent Carolina landfalls, Arthur and Matthew. This storm will not be like either of those, or like anything the US mainland has seen in a long time. It isn&rsquo;t going to just be a storm surge disaster like Katrina, or a rainer like Harvey, or catastrophic wind damage like Andrew. It has the potential to be all three, and could very well (if it doesn&rsquo;t slow down too much before land fall) be the most powerful hurricane to make landfall on the US mainland since Andrew in 1992. The Carolina coast has had a prolonged quiet period with only a few relatively minor hurricane strikes in the last 20 years. It is imperative that people do not fall victim to complacency with this storm. &hellip;&rdquo;

  <p>I found a new project earlier this summer.</p>

<p>I had lost my old barbecue thermometer in our move last year. My mother- and father-in-law bought me a new Bluetooth one for my birthday this year. Unfortunately, it had two big drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>It could only handle two probe jacks.</li>

<li><p>Bluetooth range, while nominally 100 meters, depends on the transmit power and it was clearly obvious that in order to save power that transmit power had been reduced on this device; it would not cover the house.

After considering the problem, I decided that WiFi would be a better connection mechanism to use, because:</p>
